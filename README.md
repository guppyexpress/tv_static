Using Multithread is simples. Include multithread.js on any page u wanna with wats below
------------------------------------------------------
<script src="my/path/to/multithread.js"></script>
------------------------------------------------------


And instantiate it in any script tag using
---------------------------------------------
var num_threads = 2;
var MT = new Multithread(num_threads);
----------------------------------------------



Multithread will provide the best results when num_threads matches the processor core count of the computer you're using, but 2-4 threads should be perfect and the average computer got 4 threads so 4 should be perfect
